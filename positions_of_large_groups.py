"""
In a string s of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.

For example, a string like s = "abbxxxxzyy" has the groups "a", "bb", "xxxx", "z", and "yy".

A group is identified by an interval [start, end], where start and end denote the start and end indices (inclusive) of the group. In the above example, "xxxx" has the interval [3,6].

A group is considered large if it has 3 or more characters.

Return the intervals of every large group sorted in increasing order by start index.

>>> largeGroupPositions("abbxxxxzzy")
[[3, 6]]
>>> largeGroupPositions("abc")
[]
>>> largeGroupPositions("abcdddeeeeaabbbcd")
[[3, 5], [6, 9], [12, 14]]
>>> largeGroupPositions("aba")
[]
