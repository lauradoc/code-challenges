"""
Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests)
and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that,
when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items
should then be returned in a tuple like so: (index1, index2).

For the purposes of this kata, some tests may have multiple answers; any
valid solutions will be accepted.

The input will always be valid (numbers will be an array of length 2 or
greater, and all of the items will be numbers; target will always be the
sum of two different items from that array).

Based on: http://oj.leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
